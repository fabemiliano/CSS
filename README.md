# CSS

This repository contains some of the styled pages I have created after watching some online tutorials.

I have been practicing Sass and JavaScript (sometimes JQuery) willing to improve my front-end skills.

**CSS is fun!**

Most of the styles were inpired by this youtube channel: [OnlineTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog) which I strongly recommend watching.
